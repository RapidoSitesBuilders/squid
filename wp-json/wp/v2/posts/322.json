Music that catches you and doesn&#8217;t let you go, that&#8217;s what I thought about trap music when I first heard about it.

After all, it is quite similar to dubstep and we all know just how big an impact dubstep has made on the music industry.<\/p>\n<p>Many artists are defining music as the new dubstep; it certainly has become the new craze in the industry. Although the history of the genre dates back to a decade ago, it has only recently started to gain recognition and hype.<\/p>\n<p>Many people consider the fact that since trap&#8217;s crossover to EDM it has started to grow in demand with sold out glow-sticked arenas due to EDM Trap&#8217;s popularity.
