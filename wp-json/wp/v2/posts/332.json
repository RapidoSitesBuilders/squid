In the following article we will go through 5 of the biggest mistakes new producers make when trying to reach stardom and how you can avoid them.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Lack of a unique style. So many producers now sound like cookie-cutter clones of already popular artists.<\/strong> I cannot express how important it is to stand out of the crowd. To have someone hear your music for the first time and say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard anything like this before,&#8221; is huge.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lack of social media.<\/strong> Surprisingly some producers don&#8217;t use social media or only use a limited number of social media outlets. Social media is one of the most important tools if you know how to use it correctly.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Charging people for your music.<\/strong> A lot of new producers seem to run into a problem with this one. Everyone wants to make a quick buck or two and as soon as they get the option to post their music exclusively on Beatport, iTunes, etc. they quickly take that option.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>No drive. As cliche as it sounds<strong>, if you want something you have to go get it.<\/strong> Share and talk about your music with everyone you can. Network with as many people as possible. Post your music on forums, EDM blogs, and any website possible. Just keep that drive everyday, all day. The motivation to keep pushing through failures and keep fighting for success can make even a mediocre person extraordinary. The sad truth is a lot of producers just don&#8217;t want it bad enough.<br \/>\n<strong>Fight for it.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the popularity of electronic dance music and the increased accessibility of technology more and more people are learning to express themselves and their talents through electronic music.
