Whether it was on Young Jeezy&#8217;s track, &#8220;Trap or Die&#8221;, T.I.&#8217;s sophomore ablum &#8220;Trap Muzik&#8221;, or on Gucci Mane&#8217;s mixtape, &#8220;Trap God&#8221;, the word &#8220;Trap&#8221; has been around for years in Hip Hop. So what is this recent buzz about type of music?<\/p>\n<p>Over the past year, Trap music has become the fastest growing genre of music. The overall music production of this genre consists of elements taken from predominantly Down South Hip Hop, House and Dubstep. This new style of music has been making quite a buzz in the music industry with new producers, dj&#8217;s and artists popping up daily.<\/p>\n<p>This pairing of EDM (electronic dance music) and Hip Hop has turned out to be quite the perfect match. Two genres that had previously been on completely different sides of the spectrum are now working together to bring a new energy and sound to the club scene. We now have Hip Hop producers\/artists working with EDM producers creating an exciting new genre of music.<\/p>\n<p>With this sudden surge of this style of production, we have been blessed to hear great new music from artists such as RL Grime, Flosstradamus, and Baauer. As with any new trend, we also have to filter out all the generic &#8220;Trap Remixes&#8221; and tracks that seem to flood websites such as Soundcloud on a daily basis. I&#8217;ve seen well known producers as well as bedroom producers make miserable attempts in creating Trap Music.<\/p>\n<p>The question that now looms for Trap Music is whether it will have any longevity. Is this just another trend that will fade away? Does this genre of music have what it takes to last for years to come?<\/p>\n<p>I feel that Trap Music has the potential to last. I feel this way based off the fact that the genre has roots in Hip Hop. Because of this, there are familiar sounds used in its production that can be recognized by even the newest listeners. Nightclubs are a good way to gauge any given genre of music. Dj&#8217;s will play music that keeps the energy levels high in nightclubs. Trap Music might be relatively new in the clubs, but many of the sounds used in its production come from Hip Hop tracks that have been playing in clubs for years.<\/p>\n<p>Article Source: http:\/\/EzineArticles.com\/7494174<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;ve followed artists such as Young Jeezy, T.I., and Gucci Mane, you&#8217;ve heard the term &#8220;Trap&#8221; used often.
