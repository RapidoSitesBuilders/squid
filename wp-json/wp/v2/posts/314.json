Perhaps you&#8217;re a music composer who wants to move into digital music making or maybe you&#8217;re just beginning your music composition journey. Whatever your goals, this article will be of interest to you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Notation Programs VS DAWs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Notation programs are software used to create sheet music. You would need to know how to read and write music to use it. DAWs or Digital Audio Workstations are stronger for producing professional sounding audio. The amount of sounds libraries, virtual instruments and effects are endless. DAWs have more powerful ways to manipulate notes and sounds than Notation programs.<\/p>\n<p><em>How do I decide which type of program to choose?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Generally, if you want to create great sounding audio, use a DAW. Alternatively, if you want to compose for live instruments, an orchestra, choir and won&#8217;t need to record your tracks in a studio, plus you&#8217;re game in music notation, choose a notation program.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Best Notation Programs for Music Composition<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Finale<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Finale is the cream of the crop in music notation programs and is used professionally by sheet music creators. The printed music at your local music store would most likely be made using Finale. The learning curve is a little high though, with tons of features. It may be too complicated for beginners but you can try Finale Notepad first which is a free, easier version to use.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sibelius<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The main competitor to Finale, Sibelius is great for all types of composers. Finale targets the traditionalists, and Sibelius the more general audience. Maybe too bold of a statement, but Sibelius tends to be popular with media composers such as film and video game music composers. The interface is very easy to learn and use, and is more beginner-friendly.<\/p>\n<p><em>MuseScore<\/em><\/p>\n<p>MuseScore is the best free notation program out there. It has a lot of features and is considered equal to the full blown programs such as Finale and Sibelius. A little hard to learn for the beginner, but will greatly pay off considering this is a free program with full capabilities.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are heaps of music composition software and programs on the market, but which should you use?
